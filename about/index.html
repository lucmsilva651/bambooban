        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>My name is Lucas, and at the age of 14, I'm a young man with a passion for the world of technology and programming. I was born in 2009, and from an early age, my curiosity and thirst for knowledge led me to explore the vast universe of information technology.</p>
        <p>My journey began with the discovery of HTML and a little CSS, skills that allowed me to create my own web pages. But I didn't stop there; I plunged into the world of programming and learned the Python language, albeit at an early level. Although I'm modest about Python, I consider every line of code I write to be a learning opportunity.</p>
        <p>One of my specialties is creating .bat scripts, which, I confess, I find quite charming when converted to .cmd. I like to think that I'm shaping the world of computing in a "cute" way.</p>
        <p>In my never-ending quest for knowledge, I turn to ChatGPT whenever I have questions about programming, which has been a valuable tool in my educational journey. I love learning new things and I'm always looking for challenges that broaden my horizons in the world of technology.</p>
        <p>In addition, I have a considerable knowledge of computers and even cell phones. Whenever I can, I help friends and family solve problems related to these areas, because I believe that sharing knowledge is one of the best ways to strengthen our technological community.</p>
        <p>In the future, my goal is to continue perfecting my programming skills, exploring new languages and projects that will allow me to contribute to the evolution of technology. With determination and passion, I'm looking forward to facing the challenges that the world of IT has in store for me.</p>
        <p>And of course, here are my own social media accounts (some may no longer be available).</p>
